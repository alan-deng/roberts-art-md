## Robert's Art

### A website to display and sell a client's art

Hi! If you're here from my [portfolio](https://alan-deng.github.io/portfolio-site/), welcome!
This project's code cannot be displayed because the client owns it, but I've highlighted some features and added some pictures below.

### `Website`

You can find the work-in-progress dev version of the site [here](https://roberts-art-dev.surge.sh/).

------------------------------
### `Features`

- Website separated into categories to display artwork of that category, as well as a for sale page displaying all artwork currently for sale
- Inventory management functionality to allow an admin to manage the artwork on display/sale


-------------------------------
### `Technologies`

React, Bootstrap, Express/Node.js, MongoDb, Javascript, HTML, CSS
